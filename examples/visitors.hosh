# This program reads an Apache logfile in Common Log Format, like this:
# 212.205.21.11 - - [30/Jun/2019:17:06:15 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2028 "https://example.com/ "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 8.0.0; FIG-LX1 Build/HUAWEIFIG-LX1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/64.0.3282.156 Mobile Safari/537.36"
#
# It extracts the first column of each line (the visitor IP address), counts the
# frequency of each unique IP address in the log, and outputs them by count.
